# Weather Journal App :umbrella:

## Project 3 - Weather Journal App (Second Project Udacity Nanodegree)
#### What I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript (Vanilla), ES6


### Project Objective

This project was about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather based on user's location, and dynamically update UI.

### Structure
To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

- Installed node and packages, and included in my server.js file.
- Added POST and GET routes to oost & get data.
- Got API credentials from OpenWeatherMap page.
- Created async functions to fetch weather data from API and store it on my local server. 
- Built a function that update UI dynamically.
- Validate zip code.
- UI/UX for good experience.

### Operate

- Firstly, write these commands in terminal to install packages:

1. install express `npm install express`.
2. install cors `npm install cors`.
3. install body-parser `npm install body-parser`.

- Secondly, start the server, write in terminal:

- Server is the name of the file used for server, can be anything `node server.js`.
